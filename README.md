# Intro
Hi iza!
As you can see, I've finally decided to write that Yu-Gi-Oh guide. I'm on a 13 hour flight as im writing this, so i quite literally have nothing better to do xd
This guide might get a liiitle long, but don't worry, I'll try to make it fun <3

# How do i play?
YGO is available on a lot of different devices and simulators. I would recommend using Master Duel for consoles, and YGO omega if you're playing on pc or android.

Once you're done with this guide, I'd recommend just picking a deck and starting to pay one of these simulators. Learning by doing is the best method after all! I'll have a segment for which types of decks you can try and where to get deck lists at the end of the guide.

# The Basics
The Goal of Yu-Gi-Oh (or ygo, which is how I'll be abbreviating it for the rest of the guide) is simple: Get your opponents life points to zero.
This is usually done by just attacking them with your monsters. (Both you and your opponent start out with 8000 lifepoints.)

To help you in doing that, there are three card types: **Spells**, **Traps** and **Monsters**.

These are placed in their respective zones on the field: The Monster Zone and the Spell/Trap Zone.

Each of these card types have effects. These are just the text that's written on the card in the text box. However, how you activate the effects is slightly different for each type.

**Spells:** Spells are easy. Just place them in your spell/trap (st) zone to activate them. Then just do what is written on the card. Once the effect is over, send the card to the graveyard (ygo's name for the discard pile)

**Traps:** Traps work the same as spells, but before you play them, you first need to place them face down in your st zone and wait one turn. After that turn is over, you can activate them whenever you want, even on your opponents turn! Placing a card face down is called 'setting'. Remember that, I'll use it later on.

**Monsters:** Monster effects are also simply activated when you play them, like spells. Instead, the obviously go in the monster zone. You can't just play them whenever you want though, I'll talk about that in the section about mobsters.

# More Phases than the MCU - How Turns work
YGO is a turn based card game. In order to structure the turns better, they're divided into multiple phases. Don't worry though, they're very easy to understand. I'll be explaining all of them in the order they happen.

Draw Phase: You draw one card. The start of your turn.

Standby Phase: Nothing happens here. That's why it's called the standby Phase xd. You can still activate card effects here. So can your opponent if they have trap cards or any other cards at spell speed 2 and above. (Don't worry, I'll explain that later.)

Main Phase 1: Finally, we get to play the game! This is where you play all you monsters, spells, traps, etc.

Battle Phase: In this Phase you're allowed to attack your opponents monsters with yours, or attack your opponent directly if they don't control any.

Main Phase 2: yep, there's another one! This is where you do all the stuff you forgot to do in Main Phase 1. The only difference is that **you're not allowed to play new cards, only activate ones already on the board.** 

End Phase: The end of your turn. Once again, nothing happens here unless you or your opponent activate effects.

# Become the Master of faster - Spell Speed and Quick spells

In YGO, every cards effect has spell speed. This basically just boils down to if you can activate them on your opponents turn. You also can't activate a card with a lower spell speed in response to one that has a higher spell speed.

In total, there's three levels of spell speed. 

**Spell Speed 1:** this is what every card has by default, it's the slowest speed.

**Spell Speed 2:** This is used by quick play spells. They're indicated by a icon of a lightning bolt next to their name.

**Spell Speed 3**: The fastest speed. Used by counter traps. This is indicated by a icon with an arrow next to the cards name.

If you don't understand, don't worry. You won't have to think about this much when playing online. The simulator will do all the hard work of showing which cards you can play for you. For now, just remember that some cards are faster than others.

# Kuribo, I choose you! - Summoning Monsters
In YGO, you'll need to summon Monsters to attack your opponent. There are three different ways to do that. All of them end with your placing the monster you summoned in your Monster Zone, so i won't mention that every time.

They are:
Normal Summon, Tribute Summon and Special Summon

**Special Summon:**
Ill explain this one first, as it's by far the easiest. You simply do this when a card tells you to.

**Normal Summon:**
You can do this or a tribute summon once per turn. You can only use this method if the monsters level (the amount of stars next to it's name) is at most 4.

**Tribute Summon:** 
You need to use this method to summon anything above four stars. In order to tribute summon, you need to send one monster you control to the graveyard. Two if the level of the monster you're summoning is 7 or higher.


You can summon Monsters in 2 Positions: Attack and defense. Attack Position is when the card is facing horizontally, defense is vertical. You can also place monsters face down, but only if your normal summon them.
Defense Position Monsters can't attack.
Face down cards can't activate their effects.

# Kill it with fire! - The Battle Phase
Now that you know how to summon Monsters, it's time to learn how to actually attack. For this, it's important which position the monster is in. 

If it is in defense position, simply check if your Monster has higher attack than the enemy monster's defense. If it does, destroy the enemy monster. If not, you take damage equal to the difference between the two.

If the Monster is in attack position, compare the attack of the two instead. If yours is higher, the opponent takes damage equal to the difference between the two numbers.
If they're the same, both monsters die.
If yours is lower, you take the damage instead and your monster dies.

# Teaching the fish to synchro summon - The extra deck
The extra Deck is exactly what it says on the tin - an extra deck. It consists of 15 cards, and is where you'll find most of the alternative Monster Types - XYZ, Synchro, Fusion and Link
Using it is very simple: you can simply use any card in it whenever you want, you don't need to draw them. You only have to meet the summoning conditions. Just to clarify, you can't just put any cards here, it has to be one of the types i mentioned earlier. You can summon extra deck monsters in the extra monster zone (the two zones above your regular monster zones) but you don't need to.

Now, I'm going to explain the different types. Its a good idea to read this, but you won't have to understand everything right away - you'll learn while playing.

**Fusion:** Exactly what it sounds like - A fusion between two monsters. Just have the monsters listed on the card and then use a fusion spell. These aren't a specific type of spell, they're just spells whose effects say that you can use them to summon fusion monsters. If you need to have the Monsters required for the fusion in your hand, on the field, or just in your deck depends on the spell you're using for fusion.

**XYZ:**
The Experts are still out on if this is pronunced excyzz, exceeed or just x y z. Either way, this is one of the easiest summoning mechanics to understand. Just sacrifice the monsters listed in the card, but instead of putting them into the graveyard, you place them below the monster you summoned. These are now that monsters materials. On their own, they don't do anything, but effects will often need you to detach them (put them in the graveyard)

**Link:**
Once again, just summon them by sacrificing the materials on the card. The major difference with link monsters is that they cannot be in defense position, and have red arrows pointing to different zones. These don't do anything on their own, but effects use them.

**Synchro:** 
Synchro monsters always require you to sacrifice at least two monsters - a tuner and some other monster, which ones depends on the card. A tuner monster is simply a monster that has the tuner type - types are written just above the effect in brackets. In order to summon a synchro monster, the level of all the monsters used to summon it needs to add up to the level of the monster you're summoning.

# We're almost done, i promise - ritual and pendulum monsters
There's two more special monster types that don't belong into the extra deck, but instead your regular deck: ritual and pendulum monsters. 

**Ritual Monsters:**
Ritual Monsters are simply summoned when a card tells you that you can summon them. Usually, this is a spell card specific to that monster.

**Pendulum Monsters:**
These are probably the most difficult monster type to explain. Don't worry though, once you've used them a few times, it'll be pretty intuitive.

Pendulum Monsters are Monsters _and_ Spells.
You can both summon them like a normal monster and place them in your spell/trap zone.
If the Monster is summoned normally, their regular effect is active. If it is placed in the spell/trap zone, their pendulum effect is active (the textbox above their normal effect.) You can't just place them in any spell zone, only the left and right most zones. These are called pendulum zones.

In addition to their normal level, pendulum monsters also have a pendulum level. Once you have pendulum monsters in both of your pendulum zones, you can, once per turn, do a pendulum summon. This let's you summon as many monsters from your hand as you want, as long as their levels are in-between the pendulum levels of the two cards you placed.
The pendulum card on the left always has to have a lower pendulum level than the one on the right.

# I can't think of a funny quote for this one - Chains
Now, you basically know everything you need to get started, the only thing that's missing are chains. What are chains? When your opponent activates a card effect, you are able to respond. In what order those effects happen is determined by chains. They're pretty simple, for the most part. Once you're done with a chain (neither you or your opponent have any additional responses) the card effects in the chain are activated from the last to first one played. Simulators will do this for you, so you don't need to worry too much about it.

# Some advice
YGO might seem a little complicated at first, but it's pretty intuitive once you've played a few matches. I'd recommend doing a practice game solo to get to know your deck first before playing against other players. That way you'll have all the time in the world to read your cards and understand what they actually do.


# What decks should i play?
First up, the best websites to find decks on are ygopro and master duel meta. The truth is: just play whatever you think looks cool. Yes, there are power differences between decks, but for casual matches, and in general, the most important things is to, y'know, have fun.
I'll list out some decks here that i like playing.

- Toons - very fun, if a bit repetitive. Don't try to play this irl, the cards cost way too much money.

- Flower Cardians - This should absolutely not be your first deck, but it's very fun. Inspired by traditional hanafuda playing cards (not sure if i spelled that right)

- Fur Hire - Bad puns and furries. Do i need to say more? 25/10, best deck

- Blue eyes white dragon - Nice deck for beginners, good if you like cool dragons.

- Trains - it's what it says on the tin. If you want to murder your opponent using sentient trains, this is the deck for you.

- Madolche - Deck based on french desserts and animal sounds. Pretty cute.

- there's a bunch of other cool decks out there, if none of these look like your thing, just spent a bit browsing ygo pro.


# Aaaand that's pretty much it!
I might've forgotten about some mechanic, so just ask if you need more help.
